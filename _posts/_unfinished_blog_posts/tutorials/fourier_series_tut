Learning the Fourier Series

I spent a large amount of my Sunday researching the Fourier Series in an attempt to figure out just what it is. Since I'm learning it, I decided at I'd write a simple conceptual tutorial!

For those of us who have no idea what this is (ehem... me), the Fourier Series is a mathematical representation of a certain kind of real-world wave that explains the wave as an infinite sum of sine and cosine waves. This wave needs to be periodic and repeating (a sine wave or cosine wave is a perfect example). Here it goes:


The Fourier Series (a conceptual overview of how it works):

A Fourier series is an expansion of a periodic function f(x) in terms of an infinite sum of sines and cosines

1. the trick to understanding the Fourier series is that a wave can be modelled by a combination of sine and cosine waves.

2. 99.9% of the time (with real-world data) the wave will not be perfectly symmetrical across the Y axis

--a. symmetry is even when F(t) = F(-t) (for cos(x) waves) OR odd when F(t) = -F(-t) (for sin(x) waves). --b. because the phase very likely will not line up with the y axis to give a perfectly even or odd symmetry, you need to know that the wave can be modelled by the sum of the cos and sin waves. -- --i. Basically, we know that a sin and cos wave of known frequency will have harmonics - the second harmonic has double the freq, 3rd has triple the freq, etc. -- --ii. We also know that the phases of the 2nd (ie 2*freq), 3rd (3*freq), 4th (4*freq), etc harmonics of the sin and cos waves will be a multiple of pi...(ie. make a mental picture of the 2nd harmonic of a sine wave: because you've doubled the original frequency, there will be two periods in the space of the original period. By extension, if you shifted the phase of the original by pi, then you'd shift the 2nd harmonic by 2 pi... In the second harmonic, you're moving through twice as much of the period!)

3. If you were to model the real-world wave, you'd need to: --a. find the amplitude of every corresponding harmonic. This is called the Fourier sin coefficient and cosine coefficient: this is the integral of the original function f(x) * sin(x) AND f(x) * cos(x), respectively --b. this coefficient is by definition the amplitude of every corresponding harmonic!!! (I said this again just to drill the point) --c. So... to approximate the original function f(x), you'd just need to take an integral of the original function f(x) and add the sin and cos harmonics to it. (the harmonics are the amplitude (found in part b) * the corresponding sin or cos harmonic.

That's it!

Non-math graphical application: Actually doing the math is the complicated part, and you can build simpler examples of this series in gnuplot. While you're not really doing the math, you're at least proving that you understand the concept!

   * gnuplot is a graphing program for mac/linux. windows? dunno. Here are the important commands: 

        set xrange [-10:10]
        set yrange [-10 to 10]
        set samples 10000 (**very important - makes your plot accurate)
        plot sin(x), cos(x)

Challenge 1: draw a SawTooth wave in gnuplot

Answer: Don't cheat!!! But if you must... 1. Because the sawtooth wave is a periodic function, we can use Fourier series! (Always ask the question of whether the idea is relevant. It can save so much time!)

2. Second of all, we know that the frequency, f, is changed in a sinusoidal wave like this: sin(x*f). Thus, by changing the frequency, we can begin to model all the harmonics of an original frequency:

  A sound wave example might be something like sin(x*440).  The second harmonic is sin(x*(440*2)).  Third is sin(x*(440*3)).  Try this on gnuplot!!!

3. Lets guess to use just a sin wave. This intuitively makes sense for the following reasons: --a. if you look at a sawtooth wave, it looks like a sine wave. That's a good start --b. We can make the claim that a sawtooth wave shows odd wave symmetry because a quick look at a graph of one shows that F(x) = -F(-x) --> ie the y value at x = 0.1 equals the negative of the y value at x = -0.1. Because it uses this symmetry, we can guess it's a sine wave (a sine wave also has this symmetry)

4. We can model the sawtooth wave by claiming that it's a sum of the harmonics of a sine wave. Assume the first harmonic has one period. This means the 2nd harmonic of the wave has 2 periods. Logically extend this by drawing it in gnuplot as

  plot sin(x)-3, sin(2*x), sin(3*x)+3

...the -3 and +3 are for ease of looking at on your gnuplot window... This doesn't look like much, but lets add them:

  plot sin(x) + sin(2*x) + sin(3*x

Do you see a pattern? Try more harmonics. It looks like the amplitudes shouldn't all be the same.

5. The amplitude, A, of a sinusoidal wave can be changed by: A*sin(x). Let's make the amplitude of the fundamental freq largest and reduce the amplitude of every sequential harmonic a little bin every time:

      plot sin(x)/1 + sin(2*x)/2 + sin(3*x)/3

6. Looking pretty good! Do it for 12 harmonics:

 plot sin(x)/1 + sin(2*x)/2 + sin(3*x)/3 + sin(4*x)/4 + sin(5*x)/5 + sin(6*x)/6 + sin(7*x)/7+sin(8*x)/8+sin(9*x)/9 + sin(10*x)/10 + sin(11*x)/11 + sin(12*x)/12

    As it turns out, this is actually an inverse sawtooth wave. To flip it, just add a negative sign in front of the whole expression 

 plot -1*((sin(x)/1 + sin(2*x)/2 + sin(3*x)/3 + sin(4*x)/4 + sin(5*x)/5 + sin(6*x)/6 + sin(7*x)/7+sin(8*x)/8+sin(9*x)/9 + sin(10*x)/10 + sin(11*x)/11 + sin(12*x)/12))

Challenge 2: draw a semi-circle wave

Challenge 3: draw a square wave

Challenge 4: draw a triangle wave

sorry, I'm too lazy to write the other answers, but you can look to wikipedia for the general equation and apply what you've (hopefully) learned to figure stuff out.
