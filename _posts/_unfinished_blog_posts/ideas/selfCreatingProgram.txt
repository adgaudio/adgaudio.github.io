write/think about ways to make a program write programs.  Like David Cope does for compositions.  

1. How will the program learn design structures (feed it some design patterns, and collections libraries). 
   Think of program templates and structures, meta-python.
   What is the maximum possible abstraction of a program?  Is this something that can be calculated?


2. Make it generate random structures.  Can it make a structure that replicates within some framework/medium? (*1) Once it replicates, can we make it mutate/evolve and find new ways to replicate?  (*2)  Will this become complicated enough to create an interconnected network of living things that continue to replicate in their medium, and perhaps replicate into new mediums? (*3) Will this thing eventually die, or will it just keep expanding into new mediums and re-populate old ones...? ... to be continued...



NOTES/PHILOSOPHY:

	    *1 Life is self-replicating.  All living things need a medium, or some ecosystem, on which to replicate.  Viruses and bacteria need organic molecules and sunlight, plants need bacteria, Animals need plants and other animals, and ideas need humans.  This description is terribly limited by its linear & hierarchical view, but the sense of it is that life needs a medium on which to support itself.  Perhaps all living things can be seen as self-replicating entities that evolve themselves.
	    *2 A self-replicating (living) structure can/will/should? never know with certainty what it's doing, but it could technically make some sort of 'intelligent' guesses and ideas that inform its actions.  An 'intelligence' of knowing what it is, what it wants to be, what to do next, and even how to evolve.	       The universe can be divided into 2 things: pattern and randomness.  Looking down at life from the highest level, we can claim that it is completely patterned - every structure is linked in some way to another structure, and this all ultimately leads to replication, predictability, and knowing.  It's like knowing why a worm is beng dropped into a fish tank full of barbs (type of fish) - once you drop it into the water, it will get eaten immediately, perpetuating the life of the fish in the fish tank.  From the worm's point of view, life is coming to a complete halt, but as a maintainer of the fish tank, we know that the death of this worm will promote a healthier ecosystem and continue to sustain more life in the tank.  (In a sense, the fish tank ecosystem is a live that is more alive than a single worm.)  
	    Looking at life from the worm's point of view, life is a mix of pattern and randomness.  The worm's'intelligence' enables it to recognize patterns.  The worm, if left to its own (self-replicating) devices, seeks dark and muddy areas, senses light and dark, and probably wet and dry.  However, its limited intelligence means that the state of the world around the worm is also random. It has no idea what's happening to it at the time of being eaten, except probably that it was in air and then suddenly in water and bright light.  Likewise, in its daily life, the worm doesn't have to worry about maintaining the medium in which it lives, a muddy temperature-controlled container in my fridge containing proper nutrients and comfort to enable worm reproduction.  The state of its very life, the ecosystem in which it lives, and even the fridge and fish tank, are completely random. I may forget about the container, the fridge may burn out, and the house containing fish tank and fridge may be randomly destroyed, moved or altered at any minute.  ...This is basically Marvin Minsky's Society of Mind in a nutshell.

	    *3 The questions here are: (1) Is life ultimately limited by the medium it exists on/in, and (2), What is this medium?
	    
	    First, the second question: The medium that life exists on can be both a complex and simple structure.  On a simple level, ... dunno what it is.  On a complex level, a medium is a medium of mediums.  Think of a medium like dirt - a simple and incredibly complex substance made of varying amounts of different elements.  Some dirt is good for some living things, but bad for others.  
	    So is life limited by its medium?  Worms - or plants (for want of a new subject) - are limited by the soil type and quality, yet they can over time evolve to exist on almost any type of soil.  Furthermore, at a certain point, they evolve beyond the point of being 'plants' and 'worms,' and somehow become birds and animals.  Life as a whole can be said to evolve to use new mediums, or from another point of view, life expanded the scope of what its medium is by learning about it and adapting to it.  Life was able to replicate through this medium.  I guess the conclusion here is that life is inevitably tied to a medium, but I don't have a clear understanding of what a medium is or can be.  Perhaps, as a living being myself, I will never be able to definitively define 'medium' because I am bound to my own subjective understanding - the discovery of a bunch of patterns amid a swamp of randomness. Perhaps that is the point of a medium.  Then are we bound to a medium?
	    Perhaps a medium is simply a structure, or an information network.  Clearly, we as living beings simply exist in a medium only to be able to replicate information within what we understand as our medium.  In this sense, a medium is parallel to life, but does not self replicate; instead, a medium just exists for some reason.  Why the hell does matter exist?  These questions about medium and matter are probably key to figuring out how to create life.  So... the next question is: What is it that enables replication?


	    *? More thoughts on life and matter.  ... What is life? What is matter?  How are they related?   
	    Consider the 'life of a star.'  It has a cycle where it is somehow born, starts collecting matter (via gravity), becomes a super nova, explodes, and creates new stars/galaxies which all have their own things and life forms (such as earth worms!).  A rock on earth has a similar cycle, the rock cycle: A sedimentary rock compresses into metamorphic rock and eventually becomes magma and gets spit out a volcanoe.  If the star, the universe, or a rock can be found to replicate, then are they alive?  The answer is yes.  In these situations, the rock and the star are a bunch of matter, or a medium (that is, in this point of view, not alive) that enable a replicating cycle, or a life cycle.  In the same way, the human has a physical body of flesh and bones - the bones and cell walls are themselves perhaps just a medium for life.  At the same time, however, the bones are them selves replicating and should therefore be considered alive.  Maybe "life" needs clarification.  Life is a replicating thing that, by virtue of being tied to a medium, is indiscernible from the medium.  Life organizes the medium on which it lives to perpetuate itself... 
	     A side conclusion: maybe the key to creating life is not the 'creation' of life, but the capturing of the process of replication into a stand-alone environment... what the hell does that mean/imply?
