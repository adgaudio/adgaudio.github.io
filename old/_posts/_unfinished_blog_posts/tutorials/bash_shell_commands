Unix commands are typically run inside the bash shell, which is a kind of interpreter (ie something that lets you type commands on a line and expect output)



Here are common shell commands:

You should look up all these commands in the man pages... So here is your most important command:
***
man <cmd>  shows information about the given command.  The 'See Also' section at the bottom of a man page is also often useful.
***

Moving around the filesystem:
pwd						- show current working directory (ie where you are in filesystem)
cd <dirpath>					- move around filesystem
    EX on your mac:  cd /Users/
ls						- show files and directories (aka folders) in pwd
ls <dirpath>					- same as above
ls <filepath>    

Working with files and directories:
mv <filepath> <newfilepath>			- moves files from one location to another
cp <filepath> <newfilepath>			- copy files from one location to another
rm <filepath>					- permanently delete file from filesystem (gulp...)
    never do these: rm -rf /  
                    rm *
    never use the asterisk, *, with rm. It's just too dangerous.
    actually, never use rm if possible
cat <filepath>					- shows contents of file
less <filepath>					- shows contents of file, but more interactive (type q to exit)
nano						- a text editor (be careful what you edit. type <ctrl> x to exit)
nano <filepath>					- opens a file to edit
tail						- shows last few lines of a file
head						- shows top few lines of a file
grep <word> <filepath>				- search for a word in file
grep "<phrase>" <filepath>			- search for phrase in file (ie has spaces in it)


Networking:
ssh <username>@stage01.flatworldknowledge.com	
						 - log onto stage01


How to define <filepath> and <dirpath>:
    A path can be thought of as a location in the filesystem, where the filesystem looks like a tree
    ~						- this is the path of your home directory
    .						- this is the path of your current working directory (aka pwd)


Last, the pipe symbol lets you 'pipe,' or send output of cmd1 into cmd2

    EX:  cat <file> | tail
