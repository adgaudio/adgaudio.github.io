Humans use abstraction because there is only so much complexity an individual can handle at one time.  This abstraction can be defined by concepts like modular structures: generic procedures, classes and class libraries ; circuit components, modules and complex processors, etc.  

Computers can handle higher complexity and don't need to be limited by these levels of abstraction.  The modular structure of generic procedures, classes and class libraries, or of circuits built up from components to modules to complex processors, etc, is what humans agree to use in the design of structures.  What can a computer do that humans can't?
	  Computers built on digital circuits, such as my laptop, are hugely limited because they are digital (rather than analog).  The limitation is the simple conversion of a complex analog signal into a series of '0's and '1's ('low' or 'high').  Digital abstraction is a huge limitation on the kinds of circuits that can be built and is therfore very likely a limitation on the kinds of things computers can do.  (Does cell DNA also utilize digital abstraction?  And if they don't, can digital computers reach the complexity of DNA?).
