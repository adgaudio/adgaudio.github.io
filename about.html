<p>
I'm passionate about data science, machine learning, software development, pushups, all night hacking, and intense exercise.  I am currently a data scientist and engineer at <a href="http://www.sailthru.com" target="_blank">Sailthru</a>.  I've also worked at <a href="http://www.adaptly.com/" target="_blank">Adaptly</a>, and <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com" target="_blank">Flat World Knowledge</a>.  I completed my BA in music, pre-med, and computer science at the liberal arts school, <a href="http://www.bard.edu" target="_blank">Bard College</a>, in 2010.  My professional interests include scientific computing, data science, statistics and machine learning, research and engineering.  I don't have a PhD, but I'll earn one in a few years.

My Bard College education can be though of as a mixture of concepts like "master," "abstract," "create," and "move on." At school, I completed my studies in music, computer science and pre-med.  I provided emergency care in the Emergency Room and ambulance, featured my jazz compositions and quartet on stage, modeled Soviet Literature's portrayal of man as machine with Marvin Minsky's theory of Society of Mind, discovered and invented patterns and algorithms in music, implemented Fourier transforms to manipulate heart-rate with music, and helped reshape Bard's IT infrastructure.  My college journey, like most of my life, has been an endless interplay between science and art.
