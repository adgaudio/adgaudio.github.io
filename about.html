<p>
I'm passionate about data science, machine learning, electronics, hardware, intense exercise and great food.  My professional background is primarily in building software and analytics for data-focused startups.  I also build physical machines for fun.  I recently joined a small startup as the first employee after the cofounders, called Alluvium.  Prior to that, I was a senior data scientist and engineer at <a href="http://www.sailthru.com" target="_blank">Sailthru</a>.  I've also worked at <a href="http://www.adaptly.com/" target="_blank">Adaptly</a>, and <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com" target="_blank">Flat World Knowledge</a>.  I completed my BA in music and pre-med in 2010 at the liberal arts college, <a href="http://www.bard.edu" target="_blank">Bard College</a>.

My Bard College education can be though of as a mixture of concepts like "master," "abstract," "create," and "move on." At school, I completed my studies in music, computer science and pre-med.  I provided emergency care in the Emergency Room and ambulance, featured my jazz compositions and quartet on stage, modeled Soviet Literature's portrayal of man as machine with Marvin Minsky's theory of Society of Mind, discovered and invented patterns and algorithms in music, implemented Fourier transforms to manipulate heart-rate with music, and helped reshape Bard's IT infrastructure.  My college journey, like most of my life, has been an endless interplay between science and art.
