<h3>A Self-Sourced MendelMax RepRap 3D printer</h3>
<p>
Two months, an apartment littered with hardware, curious blobs of plastic, and several all night-ers later, I have finally finished building my first 3D printer!  But my little printing revolution is nothing compared to the 3D printing movement that will revolutionize the manufacturing industry, so hang on to your seats!

<h3>Artificially Intelligent Yogurt Maker</h3>
<p>
A what?!  Well, I could have called it pid-controlled thermostat, or maybe just "milk heater," but those names just fall short.  Few people realize that a PID controller utilizes a predictive algorithm that must be "trained," or "tuned," to the proper parameters.  And yes, my yogurt is tastier than Fage...maybe not than Brown Cow, though!

<h3>Kaggle Wordpress Data Science Competition</h3>
<p>
Excitement is mounting amidst the start of my second kaggle competition!  This time around, I'm using my machine learning and data science skills to recommend the top Wordpress posts a user is most likely to "like."  There's a lot that goes into a recommendation system like this one - blended models, probability density estimation, collaborative filtering, feature extraction...  I better not say too much!  Checkout the tip of the iceberg on <a href="http://www.github.com/adgaudio/kaggle-wordpress" target="_blank">github</a>!

<h3>Kaggle Competition - <a href="http://datascienceglobal.org" target="_blank">Data Science Global</a> (Air Quality Prediction)</h3>
<p>
Sweating through the night really paid off when David, Asher and I won <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/dsg-hackathon/leaderboard?league=New%20York%20City" target="_blank">5th place in NYC</a> and 28th globally!  Predicting air pollution patterns in Chicago is tricky business, so what's our secret?  Keep it simple, keep it real, and know the math you're using!

<h3>Stanford Machine Learning Class with Andrew Ng</h3>
<p>
Well, this was pretty darn fun, I have to admit.  Coming away from this class with a <a href="/media/ml_class_statement_of_accomplishment.pdf" target="_blank">perfect score</a> in the class and two notebooks full of valuable information.  I can't tell you the number of times I've checked back to my notes in the past several months!

<h3>PyGotham</h3>
<p>
That's right, a New York City Python conference!  The brilliant idea of an awesome friend, Gloria, <a target="_blank" href="http://pygotham.org/">PyGotham</a> takes place for the first time on September 16th and 17th, 2011.  As a participant in this excellent lineup of <a target="_blank" href="http://pygotham.org/talkvote/scheduled_talks/">speakers and presentations</a>, I will give a 90 minute class about IPython and Tmux.  There will also be a Wii-mote laser-tag scavenger hunt, coding tournament, afterparty and many other fun events.  In addition to speaking, I have helped Gloria build the PyGotham website, and will be doing something mischevious with wii-motes, cell phones and IR leds!

<h3>Hunchworks, in collaboration with United Nations Global Pulse</h3>
<p>
We're developing a social networking platform to help UN analysts and crisis mappers generate hypotheses about global crises so they can more effectively identify crises and possible solutions before we are aware of them.  The platform will utilize crowd sourcing and machine intelligence to identify patterns in collected data and help users generate stronger hypotheses.  For more details, you can google the project and checkout these links:  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/global-pulse/HunchWorks/wiki/Project-background">GitHub</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://adaptivepath.com/ideas/global-pulse-hunchworks-project-week-3-challenge">Description from Adaptive Path</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/unglobalpulse/workspace-capabilities/hunch-labs">Global Pulse google page</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unglobalpulse.org/">UN Global Pulse</a>

<h3>Heartbeat: The Intelligent MP3 Player</h3>
<p>
We know that igniting feeling from We Will Rock You by Queen, and the sheer intensity of Aretha Franklin's huge voice. Many of us have drifted into the worlds of Radiohead or the Beatles. We feel music: sweaty, emotional, soothing.  We explore it: rhythmically, harmonically, analytically.  Good music is captivating on many levels, and because of this captivating effect, we can use music as a tool. 
</p>
<p>
Introducing Heartbeat, The Intelligent Music Player.  This project is inspired by <a target="_blank" href='http://heart.bmj.com/content/92/4/445.full?sid=00ffbddf-b343-4b8a-97d3-76811c05ba6c'>current findings</a> that the human heart rate increases when humans listen to faster tempos and simpler rhythmic structures (Bernardi, Porta, & Sleight, 2005).
</p>
<p>
Heartbeat, The Intelligent Music Player, is a portable mp3 player that chooses songs with highest probability of having some measurable biological effect. The device wirelessly determines heart rate via a transmitter strapped around one's chest, and it might one day also incorporate other sensors: it could measure breathing rate, determine how fast someone moves (steps per minute), analyze ambient noises, ambient temperature, even data from a cell phone about issues relevant to one's daily life: Are you sending more txt messages than you receive? Are your stocks crashing?  With some further development, Heartbeat is useful for finding out which songs invoke more general biological response, for regulating heart rate, and for maintaining musical and biological stimulation.
</p>

<p>
The next step in this project's development is to match heart rate data to a music library.  Matching rhythm signatures on the songs in a music library to heart rate data can help determine which songs would be good to run to, or good to work to.  Pattern recognition algorithms, a neural network, and machine learning can identify specific songs, and aspects of songs (like a change in tempo or the number of pauses in energy), that affect heart rate.  Given the wealth of information and approaches available, I have been trying out different ways to complete the project.  Be sure to come back and see my tutorial about FFTs, theories about visualizing the beat of a song, and whatever else I deem acceptable for public scrutiny!  I will be posting more as I develop this website and my projects.

<h3>Software contribution to Research and Education Networking Information Sharing Center</h3>
<p>
I designed and developed a darknet software package for the Shared Darknet Project at REN-ISAC.  
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.ren-isac.net/shared_darknet/" target="_blank">Shared Darknet Project</a>: "The Shared Darknet (SD) is a project under the auspices of REN-ISAC (RI). The SD objective is to develop a persistent and evolving darknet resource using combined data contributions of participating sites and joint efforts in analysis and analytics development. SD enables the discovery of operationally actionable information regarding sources of threat, the understanding of attacks, malware, threat evolution, and miscreant behavior, and is a source of real-world data for innovative research."

<h3>GaudiosOnline: An Online Family Identity Space</h3>
<p>
As the Internet becomes a larger part of who we are, the question of our identity becomes an increasingly relevant problem.  Are we mostly material bodies with skin and bones, or are we non-physical beings with a thinking mind?  Particularly as we continue to identify ourselves with online and digital spaces like Facebook and Google+, Wikipedia, and the internet in general, and as we exercise the intellectual more than the physical part of ourselves, we will continue to struggle with this question of our identity.
</p>
<p>
Welcome to Gaudiosonline, the framework for a novel kind of identity: an online home for my family.  I like to think of this as a digital space for thoughts, projects, memories and conversation.  The public facing side to this project will one day be <a href = "http://www.gaudiosonline.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3>Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) Instrument</h3>
<p>
The first time I focused a stereomicroscope with 100x magnification on my finger, I saw tiny pores holding little sweat bubbles.  Looking closer, I realized that those bubbles were getting larger as I thought about them.  Then it hit me - my thoughts controlled the amount of liquid on my finger!
</p>
<p>
A Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) Instrument, also known as the polygraph and lie detector, measures skin conductivity.  Because sweat contains salts, our fingers conduct electricity.  Specifically, dry skin has more resistance (~100,000 ohms) than moist skin (~15,000 ohms).

Since Kary Mullis (a nobel prize winning scientist and the guy who invented PCR, a method to mass reproduce DNA) has already managed to use a GSR device, a Playboy magazine, and wireless FM transmitter to impress a bunch of nurses with his psychic ability to switch on a lightbulb (from his autobiography, "Dancing Naked In The Mind Field," page 81-5), I've taken a different route.

My GSR device was originally meant for an experiment using live dancers and live music, but it turns out that we couldn't really move when wired up, so instead I piped its output to <a href="http://puredata.info/" target="_blank">PureData</a> using an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> board.  The result was crazy electronic music!
